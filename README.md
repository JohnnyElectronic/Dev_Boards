These boards are designed to be as small as possible while providing numerous connection options and a set of MOSFET drivers for LED lighting in scale model builds. Typically used in scale model builds, dioramas or other areas where a small compact SoC (System on a chip) is needed.
Everything you will need to control LED lighting, sensors, displays, etc. can be done with one of these boards. There is also a Lipo charging board to support a simple battery voltage source.
